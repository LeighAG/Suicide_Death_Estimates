This project analyzes suicide death rate estimates in the United States from 2000 to 2018 by sex, race, and Hispanic origin, using age-adjusted data obtained from [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/death-rates-for-suicide-by-sex-race-hispanic-origin-and-age-united-states-020c1). The goal was to explore trends and patterns in suicide rates across demographic groups. The project involved data cleaning, including filtering for relevant years, missing values, removing duplicates, and categorizing demographic groups. Exploratory data analysis was conducted to identify patterns and calculate year-over-year changes in death rate estimates. Key visualizations included line graphs comparing trends across demographic categories. This analysis provides insights into how suicide death rates have evolved over nearly two decades, highlighting differences across sex and racial groups.
